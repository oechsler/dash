## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status

This project emerged from my personal homelab needs for a flexible multi-user dashboard. While the core
features are production-ready and actively used in my daily workflow, the codebase is under active development as I
continue to add features and refinements. Early adopters should note this experimental status and evaluate carefully
before deploying in critical production environments.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. Please keep changes small and focused. If adding a feature, include a short rationale and
usage notes.
